# Description: In this project, you will find successful answers to questions given in the Web Developer Test 2022 required by Xymogen. I was not able to answer them adequately in the live test due to them time constraints, which in my opinion were unrealistic. The results of test no way reflects my knowledge or my skills in Modern Web Development Technologies. However, this project does. I copied 4 of the questions and I answer them here.

The questions are incomplete, for I copied them while taking a timed test, but I include what I copied in this project, and you can get the gist of the questions by reviewing them. You will find them in the Text files as "Question 1", "Question 2", etc.

The MVC questions are found in the ASP.NET MCV Project included in this repository. The Project ran on my localhost, using the assigned port (https://localhost:7119/), you will have to make the required adjustments to run the project in your environment.
The first 2 questions are MVC Controllers and Actions questions and are found in this ASP.NET MCV Project The remaining questions are JavaScript questions and are included in the static HTML files located in the JavaScript Answers folder.

A careful and considered look and these answers, as well, as their conciseness, cleanliness, and efficiency, are the true indication of my ability as a Web Developer. I have embellished them by going beyond the required answers and decorated them with CSS styling and made appropriate comments to boot.
